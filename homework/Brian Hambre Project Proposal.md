**Predicting Support Service Levels**
I’m planning to predict Service Levels for our support team at my company? Service levels are based on how quickly our support team can get to a call, any call that is dropped or waits longer than a specific time brings down the Service Level for that day.

I plan on using a dataset which includes # of support reps/location, calls taken/location, dropped calls, total calls, and service level/day.  

Currently, the data I plan on using are all in emails but I’m trying to get direct access to the data source.  The amount of data I have is currently 3 months’ worth of support data.

I chose this topic because I started in support with my company and I feel there is valuable information in this data to make better decisions on headcount, location of that headcount, and how to effieciently boost service levels.
