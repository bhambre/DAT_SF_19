**Predicting Support Service Levels**

I’m planning to predict Service Levels for our support team at my company.Service levels are based on how quickly our support team can get to a call, any call that is dropped or waits longer than a specific time brings down the Service Level for that day.

I plan on using a dataset which includes a wide variety of support data from list of support reps, # of calls taken, dropped calls, total calls, and service level/day.  

Currently, the data I have are all in emails but I’m working on getting access to the data source itself.  The amount of data I have currently is 3 months’ worth of support data.

I chose this topic because I started in support with my company and I feel there is valuable information in this data to make better decisions on headcount, location of headcount, and how to effieciently boost service levels.
