I would also include sibs, parch, fare, and cabin as I think they may impact the survival rate. I would include sibs and parch because having more family on the ship may increase or decrease your survival rate depending on who you were in the family.  Also, fare and cabin may have an impact to survial rate similar to pclass. I would probably leave name and embarked out because I feel they have no real impact on survival rate."
